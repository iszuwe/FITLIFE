🌟 Excited to share my Final Year Project! 🌟
After months of designing, coding, testing, and pixel-pushing, I'm proud to present my FYP:
 🎮 FITLIFE – a 2D RPG game focused on promoting healthy living through gamification.
In FITLIFE, players help a character improve their health by managing diet, making better food choices, and staying active. The game includes:
 ✅ Interactive NPCs
 ✅ Health, diet, and satiety bars
 ✅ Educational notes and quizzes
 ✅ Reward system with coins
 ✅ Save/load system with custom UI
🛠️ Built with: Unity, C#, Aseprite, and Visual Studio
This project reflects my passion for game development, interactive learning and using technology to make a real impact.

Would love to connect with anyone in the industry! Let’s build something meaningful together. 🙌
